compile_assets
==============

Sprockets compilation of assets, just playing right now.

Assumptions
-----------

You have the following project structure:

```
.
├── assets
│   └── images
│   └── javascripts
│   └── stylesheets
├── fonts
```

It compiles those assets into a `public/assets` folder, mimicking how Rails asset compilation works.

I might need something like this soon, so I figured I'd spit it out into a public project to work from.

P.s. This is ugly and a prototype.
